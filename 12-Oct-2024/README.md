## VITRON: A Unified Pixel-level Vision LLM for Understanding, Generating, Segmenting, Editing

[Code](https://vitron-llm.github.io/) | [Paper](https://haofei.vip/downloads/papers/Skywork_Vitron_2024.pdf)

## Summary:

Vitron tries to address two common gaps with MLLMs (multimodal LLMs):
1. MLLMs are generalist e.g., they have coarse-grain instance-level understanding.
2. Lack of unified support for both images and videos and their coverage.
